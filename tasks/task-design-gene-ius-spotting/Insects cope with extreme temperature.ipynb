        "#Research Topic Selection\n",
        "\n",
        "In the first step, we have to select the right study topic. The available options are birds, insects, flies, and bats. There are many reasons that can influence the choice of a suitable research topic. In this section, we mention some of these cases and try to justify the selection of our group based on them.\n",
        "\n",
        "- How relevant is the topic to our field of study? As undergraduate students in computer science, we have not any mentionable research experience in bioinformatics or biology. So this is not an effective point.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Does the topic have a clear question or research gap? Bats are very amazing creatures. They are among the rare flying creatures that are mammal. It makes them an interesting source of different kinds of studies. Also insects and flies look so simple; Discovering the complexities of their functionallity uhder this simplity is an interesting topic for any researcher and they are another potential candidate for being selected.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Is the topic feasible to conduct with our time, money budget, equipment, and ...? Our main goal is to design a theoritical report and we won't examine our results in a lab; So budget and equipment are not important problems and all we need to care about is time. The time consumption of the available topics is not different. So there is not any effective point in this reason.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Does the topic have sufficient literature and data sources? It seems that insects and flies have more studies and publications on gene expression analysis than birds and bats. This may be because insects and flies are easier to manipulate and breed in the laboratory. They also have shorter generation times and simpler genomes than birds and bats.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion we thaught researching about insects is more suitable for us. There are multiple interesting points about them that are discoverable. For example some insects like ants have complicated socail life. This is tempting to learn about them. But we select to study about \"How do insects cope with extreme temperatures, such as cold or heat shock?\". In different seasons insects can be seen. How do their bodies make them capable of it?"

        "- [Transcription analysis of the stress and immune response genes to temperature stress in Ostrinia furnacalis](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2019.01289/full): This study used RNA-Seq to investigate the expression levels of stress and immune response genes in the Asian corn borer, a major pest of maize, under high and low temperature stress. The results showed that cold stress induced immune responses, while heat stress activated stress response genes, such as heat shock proteins, glutathione S-transferase, and cytochrome P450. The authors also found that ferritin, an iron storage protein, was involved in regulating the total iron concentration in the hemolymph, which might help the insect survive temperature stress.\n",
        "- [Integrated ATAC-Seq and RNA-Seq data analysis to reveal regulatory mechanisms of heat stress response in honey bees](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/6/5619). This study used ATAC-Seq and RNA-Seq to investigate the chromatin accessibility and gene expression changes in honey bee workers under heat stress. The authors identified 2,216 differentially accessible regions and 1,636 differentially expressed genes that were associated with heat stress response. They also revealed the transcription factors and pathways that were involved in regulating the heat stress response, such as NF-ÎºB, HSF, and MAPK. This study provides a comprehensive view of the epigenetic and transcriptional regulation of heat stress response in honey bees.\n",

The authors identified genes that are differentially expressed in specific neuronal and glial types, as well as genes that are involved in neural development and function. This atlas provides a valuable resource for understanding how genes regulate neural circuits and behavior in insects under various environmental conditions, including temperature stress.\n",

The authors identified four distinct cell types based on their gene expression patterns: heat-tolerant, heat-sensitive, heat-activated, and heat-repressed. They also revealed the roles of different signaling pathways, such as abscisic acid, ethylene, and jasmonic acid, in modulating the cellular responses to heat stress. This study provides insights into the molecular basis of plant-insect interactions under temperature stress.\n",
        "- [Mitochondrial dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum stress involved in oocyte aging: a study using single-cell RNA-Seq](https://ovarianresearch.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13048-019-0529-x): This study used single-cell RNA-Seq to explore the molecular mechanisms of oocyte aging in the silkworm, a model organism for insect reproduction. The authors compared the transcriptomes of young and aged oocytes and found that mitochondrial dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum stress were the main factors affecting oocyte quality and fertility. They also identified several genes that were associated with oocyte aging, such as Bcl-2, p53, and HSP70. This study sheds light on the effects of temperature stress on insect reproduction and development."

Then, using a tool such as HTSeq or featureCounts to count the number of reads mapped to each gene and generate a count matrix, makes sense. Next, we are able to use a tool such as DESeq2 or edgeR to normalize the count matrix, estimate the dispersion, and perform differential expression analysis between different temperature conditions.

Then, using a tool such as Seurat or Scanpy to filter out low-quality cells and genes, normalize the count matrix, scale the data, perform dimensionality reduction using methods such as PCA, t-SNE, or UMAP, cluster the cells based on their gene expression profiles, and visualize the results makes sense. Next, we are able to use the same tools to perform differential expression analysis between different cell clusters and different temperature conditions, and annotate the cell clusters based on their marker genes.

This sill allow us to identify the similarities and differences between the global and single-cell gene expression patterns and the common and cell-type-specific pathways that are affected by temperature stress. we are also able to use a tool such as scmap or SingleR to project the RNA-Seq data onto the single-cell analysis data and assign cell-type labels to the RNA-Seq samples based on their nearest single-cell neighbors.
